This is the repository associated with the technical assessment for Michael Allen Company, submitted October 23 2022.

Test Question: 

Our client, a specialty oncology company, is considering entering a new therapeutic area, Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM).  You are requested to analyze the data provided (attached GBM patient data in .csv format) and create a short report to guide a 30-minute discussion with the management team.  Our client is specifically interested in using the attached data to better understand the structure of the GBM market, i.e., identifying clinically meaningful patient sub-segments that are currently treated differently and may present distinct opportunities.

You can use any software package you prefer, but please convert your report to PDF before sending it to us. Additionally, please make sure that your report does not exceed 5 pages and your name is listed on top of each page.  We look forward to receiving your response.
